                This website has been designed to encode and encrypt messages into a file format that will be woven into cloth.  The message you submit through this website will be stored in its encrypted format in our database until it is ultimately woven into one collective textile with all the messages submitted over the course of this exhibition.  As a token of our gratitude for your contribution, you will be provided with a paper copy of your encrypted message along with its decryption key through the receipt printer on display here in the museum.
